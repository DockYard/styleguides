## Overall approach
### Do whatever is best for human user experience above all else.
As search engine algorithms have evolved over time, they’ve begun to strongly favor sites that simply have well-structured, relevant, and engaging content.

Search engine rankings are speculated to give significant weight to sites with:
* Semantic markup
* Responsive web design
* Strong adherence to accessibility standards

Positive, organic user engagement metrics (low bounce rate, time on site, number of pages per session, etc.) also support better page rank as an indicator of good content quality and site credibility.

*Don’t* put too much effort into chasing “advanced” SEO strategies.

Sites that place too much effort on building backlinks and other tactic-driven strategies are sacrificing resources that instead could be directed at improving the user experience and content.

Many of these efforts produce diminishing returns on time invested, and most meaningful metrics such as site reputation can be improved organically with strong UX and engaging content.

## Head related
* Meta title (get as close to *55 characters* as possible, but try to not go over)
* Meta title should include: *Page Name* | *Target Keyword Phrase* | *Brand Name*
* Target keyword phrase is optional if character count allows
* Meta description (get as close to *155 characters* as possible, but try not to go over)
* Meta description should repeat same *page name*, *target keyword phrase*, and *brand name* in well-crafted narrative copy that *accurately describes the page content* and encourages users to click the link to learn more or take action.
* *Don’t* add meta keywords
  * They are not considered necessary and even *considered detrimental by some SEO experts*. They were historically “stuffed” by users who were trying to inorganically get better search rankings by jamming in tons of irrelevant keywords. At best, most search engines don’t give any weight to this content (*most search engines stopped using them for web ranking in 2009*), and some may view it as less credible content.

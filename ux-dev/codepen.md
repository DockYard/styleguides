# CodePen Best Practices

## Personal vs DockYard Account

Use your personal account if you’re working on a personal project or something outside of work.

The DockYard account should be used for client work, blog posts, the interview process, and other UXD initiatives in the future.

## Pen Naming Convention

The title of a pen should always include the author’s name to ensure appropriate attribution.

* If the pen is private, the title should include the client codename or internal project it is part of.
* If the pen is public, the title should include a short description for easy searching.

## Public vs Private Pens

A pen should be public when it:

* is included in a blog post
* is part of other future UXD initiatives

A pen should be private when it:

* is used for debugging/troubleshooting/bike shedding
* is part of the interview process
* contains any client details/information/data/etc

## Cleaning Up Past Pens

If a pen is only used for quick troubleshooting or examples, but no longer has relevance to a project or the team, please remove it to keep our account up to date

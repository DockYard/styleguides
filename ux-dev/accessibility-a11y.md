## Discovery/Testing/Audits

### Keyboard Testing
Testing your work with a keyboard allows you to ensure that you have distinct focus states and that the tab order is logical.

The following keyboard commands are helpful:
- `Tab` to navigate between interactive elements
- `Shift + Tab` to navigate backwards
- `Enter` to activate links and buttons
- `Space` to activate checkboxes and buttons

### Screenreader Testing
All screenreaders will read markup in slightly different ways. Manually testing your work with a screenreader is important because it allows you to confirm that any items that need hidden text have it available, that your hidden text makes sense, and that any extraneous information is hidden from the screenreaders.

Possible screenreaders to use to test your work include:
 - VoiceOver (Mac only, activate with `⌘ + F5`)
- [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/) (cross-platform)

For VoiceOver, the following keyboard commands are helpful:
- `Control + Option + H` to navigate between headings
- `Control + Option + X` to navigate between lists
- `Control + Option + T` to navigate between tables
- Arrow keys to navigate between radio buttons, select/dropdown options, sliders, and tab panels

## Process

### Start with Clean, Semantic Markup

When beginning the UXD process for any new page or component, always start with a plain HTML outline to carefully plan a clean, semantic structure.

This process is helpful for taking advantage of semantic HTML5 elements wherever possible, and also providing an intuitive/valid hierarchy for headings and content. Additionally, this exercise reveals where additional information not provided in the visual design will be required to add context for users who rely on screenreaders, thereby providing helpful hidden text that otherwise might be overlooked.

For further learning, reference [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) for guidance as you draft HTML markup.

#### `lang` Attribute

Don't forget to include the `lang="…"` attribute on the `<html>` element, and specify the content's language. This allows screen readers to understand the content's langauge for proper pronounciation, and screen readers can even read multiple languages fluidly to the user. The `lang` attribute also facilitates translations.

The `lang` attribute can also be used on a more granular level. If content within a page is in a different language, that specific content can be wrapped in an element that has it's own dedicated `lang` attribute with the corresponding value.

#### Use ARIA with Caution

The WAI-ARIA documentation begins with ["No ARIA is better than bad ARIA"](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#no_aria_better_bad_aria). ARIA is very powerful in its ability to provide additional context, semantics, and even functionality for screen reader users. But, this comes with great responsibility, as using ARIA incorrectly can be more damaging to the user experience than simply not using it at all.

#### Landmark Regions

Landmark regions, such as `<nav>`, `<header>`, or `<aside>`, should represent unique content regions within a page. If these semantic HTML elements are repeated within the same page, they should have a dedicated label to help different their unique purpose. This can be achieved with `aria-labeledby` that points to an ID of the region's heading, or an `aria-label` if no heading is present. These labels should be brief and not include the name of the region. Reference the [General Principles of Landmark Design](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#general-principles-of-landmark-design) for further guidance.

Example:
```hbs
<nav aria-label="Site">
  …
</nav>
…
<nav aria-label="Profile">
  …
</nav>
```

### Color Contrast

When receiving any new design, review all combinations of foreground/background colors that involve text and/or interactive icons to ensure they meet WCAG 2.0 minimum color contrast requirements.

If a color combination fails to meet standards, communicate this issue to the design team, and optionally recommend a close alternative that passes the standard by only adjusting the lightness value of the color.

Recommended color contrast checkers:
- Contrast ratio checkers
  - [http://accessible-colors.com/](http://accessible-colors.com/)
  - [http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/) (helpful for quickly finding a passing alternative by only adjusting the lightness value)
  - [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org/) (also includes tests for color blindness)
  - [Contrast Analyser](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/)

### Color Blindness

In addition to ensuring colors have sufficient contrast between fore/background elements, it is also important to consider the various types of color blindness users may experience when evaluating color values and combinations.

### Review/Audit

As part of the QA process for UXD work, ensure the page/component is accessible with automated audits and manual testing.

As a first pass, use keyboard navigation and screenreader software to ensure all content is navigable, functional, and understandable for non-sighted users. Use [Vox's Accessibility Checklist](http://accessibility.voxmedia.com) (particularly [the Engineer section](http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/#engineers)) as a guide for review.

As a second pass, take advantage of Chrome's Accessibility Audit, which can be accessed within Inspector Tools' Audits tab, to find any issues/areas of opportunity.

## Common Patterns

### Hidden Text

Visual presentations often communicate more information and context than what is provided by text alone, or act as a summary of complex information for quick understanding. Graphs, status indicators, and color codes/categories are common examples of this. Additionally, distinct content sections or even the page itself may not have an associated visible heading.

#### No `<h1–6>` is visually present

- Ensure each page has a relevant, unique `<h1>` that matches the URL path/SEO title.
- If a distinct content section only shows paragraph, list, etc. information, make sure a hidden heading of an appropriate level is provided as a landmark for screenreaders.

#### The visual presentation is inherently communicative/contextual

If any purely-visual element of a UI design is intended to disclose information to the user, ensure a hidden text alternative is provided for screenreaders.

- Ex: An agenda shows a timeline of scheduled event markers of various widths and colors to demonstrate the number, duration, and category of events occurring throughout the month.
  - A hidden text heading/summary of the agenda should be provided before the detailed list of event information. For example,
  > "Overview of April, 2018.
  > 32 events from April 2 to April 23 from 5 categories."
  - Following the summary, each visual event indicator should contain hidden detail text, including the event category, title, duration, etc. For example,
  > "Conference event on April 15, 2018 from 9:00 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Please arrive early and check in at the registration table."

#### The image or element is purely decorative

- Decorative images don't add context or information to a page, and are used solely for layout or visual interest. Decorative images should have an empty alt attribute `alt=""`. Leaving the alt attribute empty means screenreaders will skip over the image.
- Decorative images or elements can also take advantage of the `role="presentation"` attribute, which removes elements from the accessibility tree

### Images and Icons

- An effective alt attribute focuses on the function and purpose of the image, rather than a description of the image. It is concise. It avoids phrases such as "picture of," "graphic of," etc. For more info, [reference WebAIM's guidelines](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).
  - Example: `<img src="puppy.jpg" alt="Golden doodle puppy playing with chew toy">`
- The alt attribute of a logo doesn't need to include the word "logo." A common practice is to set the alt attribute of a logo to the company's name.
  - Example: `<img src="logo.png" alt="DockYard, Inc.">`
- To make your SVGs accessible, reference the [accessibility section of the SVG guide](https://github.com/dockyard/styleguides/blob/master/ux-dev/svg.md#accessibility).

### Icon Buttons/Links

A common UI pattern is to use icon-only interactive buttons/links to make the visual presentation easier to scan and save space. Because `aria-label` cannot be translated, and we avoid empty `<button>` or `<a>` tags, instead provide visually-hidden text within the button/anchor tag:

```hbs
<button>
  <span class="t-hidden">Close</span>
  <svg>
    …
  </svg>
</button>
```

or

```hbs
<a href="…">
  <span class="t-hidden">Close</span>
  <svg>
    …
  </svg>
</a>
```

### Focus States

All interactive elements should have a visible focus state to assist users who rely on keyboard navigation. Ideally, focus states are styled to ensure the focus "ring"/outline meets minimum color contrast requirements to aid users in wayfinding.

#### Bad Approach

Because the default focus ring isn't very visually appealing, a common pattern for buttons and link buttons is to simply match the hover and focus state styles:

```css
.button {
  color: white;
  background-color: slateblue;

  &:hover,
  &:active,
  &:focus {
    background-color: indigo;
  }
}
```
However, when evaluating this during keyboard navigation testing, the hover styles are often too subtle for users to easily locate their current location on the screen.

#### Good Approach

For these reasons, it is best to still provide dedicated styles for focus states that look great, have nice transitions, and help users find their place:

```css
.button {
  color: white;
  background-color: slateblue;

  &:hover,
  &:active {
    background-color: indigo;
  }

  &:focus {
    outline: 2px solid indigo;
  }
}
```

Shown above is IBM Carbon's default, hover, and focus button styles. [View the full button design system](http://carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/code) and use keyboard navigation to view the focus state styles and animations.

### Heights

Hardcoding heights can introduce issues when users zoom the browser in and out, as enlarged text might overflow a container, causing visual disruption and also cause content to be illegible.

#### Bad Approach

Setting heights to hardcoded pixel values makes containers inflexible and unresponsive to browser zooming:

```css
.header {
  height: 128px;
}
```

#### Good Approach

Use `min-height` to set a default container height, but allow the container to grow if text is enlarged or wraps to a new line due to browser zooming:

```css
.header {
  min-height: 8rem;
}
```

### Units

Pixel units hardcoded dimensions into a UI, and can prevent users from updating their browser default root font size, or zooming the interface as desired.

Use `rem` and `em` as the units of choice. They can be used for all dimensions, including media queries, without downsides.

Note: avoid using "scaled" `rem`s, such as `html { font-size: 62.5%; }`. This causes inconsistencies across browsers in how `rem` is measured withinin media queries. Instead, just use default `rem` for all work.

### Custom form elements

Custom form elements often include multiple inputs and buttons that appear as a single input and have a single visual label. For accessibility, each input should have an associated label that can be hidden, and the visual "label" can instead be a heading to help group the inputs as a distinct section.

```hbs
<fieldset class="form-field-group">
  <legend class="form-label">Start and end time</legend>
  <div class="form-field-duo">
    <div class="form-field-duo__half">
      <label class="t-hidden" for="startTime">Start time</label>
      <input name="startTime" id="startTime" type="time">
    </div>
    <div class="form-field-duo__half">
      <label class="t-hidden" for="endTime">End time</label>
      <input name="endTime" id="endTime" type="time">
    </div>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

#### Custom checkbox/radio inputs

Custom checkboxes and radio inputs have many states that must be styled appropriately:
- Unchecked
  - Default
  - Hover
  - Focus
  - Disabled
- Checked
  - Default
  - Hover
  - Focus
  - Disabled

This is made particularly challenging due to the approach often used for custom checkbox/radio inputs, which relies on visually hiding the native input and instead using pseudo elements on the associated label to represent the input:

```hbs
<fieldset class="form-field-group">
  <legend class="form-label">Options</legend>
  <div class="form-checkbox">
    <input
      class="form-checkbox__input"
      type="checkbox"
      name="option1"
      id="option1">
    <label class="form-checkbox__label" for="option1">Option 1</label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-checkbox">
    <input
      class="form-checkbox__input"
      type="checkbox"
      name="option2"
      id="option2">
    <label class="t-form-input form-checkbox__label" for="option2">Option 2</label>
  </div>
  <div class="form-checkbox">
    <input
      class="form-checkbox__input"
      type="checkbox"
      name="option3"
      id="option3">
    <label class="t-form-input form-checkbox__label" for="option3">Option 3</label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```

As a result, we have to be clever in our pseudo selectors on the input to visually reflect the current state with the label:

```css
.form-checkbox {
  …
  &:not(.is-disabled),
  &:not(.form-checkbox--disabled) {
    …
    &:hover {
      .form-checkbox__input {
        &:not(:disabled) {
          &:not(:checked) + .form-checkbox__label:before {
            /* Unchecked hover styles go here */
          }
          &:checked + .form-checkbox__label:before {
            /* Checked hover styles go here */
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  &.is-disabled,
  &.form-checkbox--disabled {
    /* Disabled styles go here */
  }
}

.form-checkbox__input {
  /* Visually hide native input */
  &:not(:focus):not(:disabled) {
    &:not(:checked) + .form-checkbox__label:before {
      /* Unchecked default styles go here */
    }
    &:checked + .form-checkbox__label:before {
      /* Checked default styles go here */
    }
  }
  &:not(:checked):focus + .form-checkbox__label:before {
    /* Unchecked focus styles go here */
  }
  &:checked:focus + .form-checkbox__label:before {
    /* Check focus styles go here */
  }
  &:disabled {
    /* Disabled styles go here */
    & + .form-checkbox__label {
      /* Disabled styles go here */
      &:before {
        /* Unchecked disabled styles go here */
      }
    }
    &:checked + .form-checkbox__label:before {
      /* Checked disabled styles go here */
    }
  }
}
```

### Modals/Dialogs

**Please note**: much of the required functionality, focus management, and statefulness for modals will require close collaboration with Engineering to be fully implemented.

#### Announcing

When a modal/dialog opens, screenreader focus should be brought to the first focusable child of the dialog (which is typically the close button in a message dialog). At this point, the screenreader should announce the dialog title and any following content.

#### Focus Cycling/Trapping

Dialog markup should be a direct descendant of the `<body>` element, and a sibling of the main content wrapper. By default, the "closed" dialog should have `role="dialog"` and either/both a `hidden` attribute (if appropriate browser support exists) or `display: none;` to ensure it is not focusable until it is open.

When a user interacts with a button that opens a dialog, focus should move from the triggering button to the first focusable child of the dialog. If there are multiple focusable children, focus should proceed through the elements until focus arrives at the dialog close button. If the user continues to `Tab`, focus may proceed to the browser URL bar, but then should cycle back to the first focusable child of the dialog, repeating the cycle.

Focus should be trapped within the dialog when it is open. This is guaranteed by making the sibling main content element "inert", typically with `aria-hidden="true"`.

If the user interacts with the dialog close button, the main content element should be reset to `aria-hidden="false"`, the dialog markup should be hidden, and focus should return to the button that originally opened the dialog.

If the user completes an action within the modal that results in a new route (such as submitting a form within a modal), focus should be brought to the first landmark in the new page. It is important to verify that screenreaders successfully re-index the page's contents when the app has routing in place that does not refresh the browser window (a common "single-page-app" pattern in frontend frameworks).

### Alert Banners

**Please note**: much of the required functionality, focus management, and statefulness for alert banners will require close collaboration with Engineering to be fully implemented.

Alert banners should have their role attribute set to `alertbanner`. They also should have either: `aria-labelledby` that references the element containing the title of the banner if it has a visible title or an `aria-label` attribute if there is not a visible title. In addition, the element needs an `aria-describedby` attribute that references the content of the alert banner.

Screenreader focus is given to the actionable item within the banner (typically a button) and the title and message of the alert is read.

```hbs
<div class="banner banner--success" role="alertdialog" aria-label="Success notification" aria-describedby="bannerMessage">
  <div class="banner__details">
    <div class="banner__details__copy">
      {{svg-jar "icons/icon-banner-success" class="banner__details__icon banner__details__icon--success"}}
      <p class="t-body banner__details__message" id="bannerMessage">Calendar successfully published.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <button class="button-text button-text--setback banner__button-setback">
    {{svg-jar "icons/icon-close" class="button-text__icon"}}
    <span class="button-text__text">Dismiss</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

#### Dismissal

Alerts should not automatically disappear without receiving user input. This guarantees users have enough time to read and understand the alert message, and intend for the alert to be dismissed and resume their activity. It is best to provide a dedicated dismissal button that receives screenreader focus upon the alert becoming active.

Upon dismissmal, the user's focus should return to the last focusable element. If the alert banner appears upon a change in route in the application (such as a confirmation/success alert on a new page after the user submits a form), focus should be brought to the first landmark in the new page after the alert banner is dimissed. It is important to verify that screenreaders successfully re-index the page's contents when the app has routing in place that does not refresh the browser window (a common "single-page-app" pattern in frontend frameworks).

For more information, reference [WAI-ARIA's guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#alertdialog) and [A11ycast's episode on alerts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lzAj1ahRSI).

## Helpful Tips

### Animation

Animation can be used to help with wayfinding or to surprise and delight users. It's important to use animation in a responsible way as it can trigger [vestibular disorders](https://a11yproject.com/posts/understanding-vestibular-disorders/). For a deep dive, read Val Head's article on [animating responsibly](http://alistapart.com/article/designing-safer-web-animation-for-motion-sensitivity/).

High level tips for animation:
- Be careful of too much motion
- If there is continuous motion, include ways for users to stop and hide the animation ([W3C Criteria 2.2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F16.html)), and strongly consider having the motion paused by default.
- Avoid strobing and fast motion
- Utilize the [`prefers-reduced-motion`](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/) media query for users who have opted to reduce motion at an OS level.


## ARIA

- Most ARIA roles are implicit in semantic HTML5 elements. Reference [the document conformance table from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance) to see if an element needs an explicit ARIA role. If you set an explicit ARIA role, note that each element should only have one role and that you should not set a role that overrides the semantics of an element.
- `aria-hidden` is an attribute that accepts a boolean that tells screenreaders if they should ignore or show content. If you're toggling visibility of content, don't forget to also toggle `aria-hidden`'s boolean. For more information, [view the W3C's documentation of aria-hidden](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-hidden).
- Similar to `aria-hidden`, `aria-disabled` is an attribute that accepts a boolean that tells screenreaders that the element it's applied to (and its children) are visible but inoperable. [view the W3C's documentation of aria-disabled](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-disabled).
- `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` are similar attributes in that they both associate a label to another element. If the label text is visible, use `aria-labelledby`. Otherwise, use `aria-label`. view the W3C's documentation of [aria-label](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label) and [aria-labelledby](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby).
- For more information, reference Google's Intro to ARIA or MDN's ARIA basics.
